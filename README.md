# Image-Classification
This is a simple project which showcases Image Classification using flask.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project was the inbuilt VGG-16 which is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
# Important libraries
The libraries used here were the Keras API.
# Input
The image is uploaded from the user side
# Output
the output gives a probability and a prediction(classification) saying that the image looks like so-and-so category
